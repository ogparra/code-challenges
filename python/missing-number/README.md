Vaibhav likes to play with numbers and he has n numbers. One day he was placing the numbers on the playing board just to count that how many numbers he has. He was placing the numbers in increasing order i.e. from 1 to n. But when he was putting the numbers back into his bag, some numbers fell down onto the floor.
